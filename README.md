It brings together datasets for Amazon and Netflix, enabling users to explore growth patterns, revenue trends, engagement metrics, and more — all in one interactive interface.

## 🎯 How the Central Click Button Works

At the center of the dashboard is a **clickable button** (or selector) that allows users to:

- 🔁 **Toggle between Amazon and Netflix views**  
- 📊 **Switch between key metrics** (e.g., revenue vs user engagement)  
- 📅 **Change the time range or focus** (yearly, quarterly, etc.)  

Clicking the button triggers filters or bookmarks inside Power BI, making the visuals update interactively.

💡 This creates a **one-click experience** that zooms into specific insights without manually changing slicer settings.
